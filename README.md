## How To Use This Repo

Welcome to [Getting Started with React Hooks][go]!

The master branch of this repo is a starting point that is meant to go along with a series of [slides][slides]. Each chapter contains markdown files that include instructions for the exercise as well as teaching materials. All Go files are located under the code/ directory of each chapter that include both teaching materials and solutions to the exercises (if applicable). 

## Setup

To take full advantage of the examples and exercises in this repo, make sure to [download and install at least React v16](golang.org/dl). Additional instructions for setting up are as follows:
* `git clone https://github.com/Azen-Enterprise/DR-JS-workshop.git`
* `cd react-hooks-introduction-master`
* `yarn` to install all dependencies
* `yarn start` to run application
* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in the browser to view application

## Tasks
* Refactor application to use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
